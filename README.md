# DSA Practice Repository
This repository contains solutions and implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, developed as part of my learning journey in the DSA course. Each folder corresponds to a different topic, covering a wide range of data structures and algorithmic techniques.

# Contents
# Arrays
Implementations and exercises related to one-dimensional and multidimensional arrays, including basic operations and algorithmic problems.

# Linked Lists
Implementation of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists along with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

# Stacks and Queues
Solutions to problems related to stacks, queues, and their applications like expression evaluation and more.

# Trees
Concepts of binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and tree traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

# Graphs
Graph representation (adjacency list, matrix) and traversal algorithms like DFS, BFS, and shortest path algorithms.

# Sorting and Searching Algorithms
Popular sorting algorithms like bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort, and various searching techniques including binary search.

# Dynamic Programming
Solutions to dynamic programming problems such as the knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, and other optimization problems.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find an issue or want to add new problems and solutions, please feel free to create a pull request.
